# 📚 OuVault  
**Oujisan's Markdown Collection**
A personal vault of markdown notes synced from Obsidian, shared live via [OuMarkdown](https://oumd.vercel.app).

## 🚀 Overview
OuVault is a public GitHub repository where I write, organize, and version-control my markdown notes — mostly created using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).  
All notes here are automatically rendered and published on the web through my personal markdown blog: [oumd.vercel.app](https://oumd.vercel.app).

> [!NOTE] 
> This repo only stores the raw markdown files. If you're looking for a reading experience, head over to [OuMarkdown](https://oumd.vercel.app).

## ✍️ Structure
Each file follows the pattern: `# [{category}] {title}`

This format allows the frontend to:
- Auto-detect the category
- Display appropriate icons
- Group and filter content efficiently
